# Biography
I grew up in Halifax Nova Scotia, and attended Dalhouse University.  For my undergraduate research I worked in the [Aerosol and Cloud Group](http://pierce.atmos.colostate.edu/) on the link between cosmic ray flux and cloud formation, and improving modelling of sea-salt aerosol production.  After completing my BSc I moved into the [Quantum Theory Group](http://quantum.phys.dal.ca/index.html) and worked on translating classical problems of interest (mostly [3-SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#3-satisfiability)) onto Quantum computers, culminating in my thesis [Compiling Programs for an Adiabatic Quantum Computer](https://github.com/esnowkropla/eskthesis).

In addition to various stints as a software developer, from 2015-2017 I was the co-founder and lead programmer at [Two and Thirty Software](http://twoandthirtysoftware.com) working on [Hairy Little Buggers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/405240/Hairy_Little_Buggers/). From 2017-2018 I was the technical lead at the [Klick Health](https://www.klick.com/) Media Data Science team. Currently, I consult on ETLs, data science and software development, while also working on [SponsorHub.io](https://www.sponsorhub.io).
