A certain critic - for such men, I may regret to say, do exist - made
the nasty remark about my last novel that it contained 'all the old
Wodehouse characters under different names'. He has probably
now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of
the prophet Elisha: but if he still survives he will not be to
make a similar charge against *Summer Lightning*. With my
superior intelligence, I have outgeneralled the man this time
by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same
names.  Pretty silly it will make him feel, I rather fancy.
