This entry will be a little scattershot, just some miscellaneous thoughts and impressions.

## Interacting with APIs
It's a little inconvenient to be making a lot of little structs for each feature of an API; where in JavaScript or Python you would have a dictionary, if you want type safety you need to make a struct with the proper fields. Strictly speaking you don't *need* to; operating on [untyped JSON](https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/#operating-on-untyped-json-values) is actually fairly straightforward, but when you know that the rest of your codebase isn't going to crash the parts that aren't guarenteed by the compiler niggle in your brain.  The [serde-rs](https://github.com/serde-rs/json) library is everything I want in a JSON serialization library. There's not much in particular to call out, which is good in an infrastructure library; although I can say it's ... much more ergonomic than the serialization I wrote for [Hairy Little Buggers](http://www.hairylittlebuggers.com).

I wrote about half a dozen little programs to scrape data from YouTube and Twitch as part of [secret project](http://www.this link doesn't go anywhere dot com), as well as the main app; I would probably do one-off scraping type scripts in Python in future, with app code written in Rust.

## Type Safety!
Rust's type safety gives is extremely hard to give up; working with Python I constantly have to think harder about the inputs and outputs of my functions, becase the source and compiler isn't doing it for me.
